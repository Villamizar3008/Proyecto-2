    <h1>What is XML?</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup     <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTD) or an <strong>XML schema</strong> to describe<br>the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive
        </strong></li>
    </ul><br>

    <h1>The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>
      <p><strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong> </p>
      <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.<br>
        XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>
      <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is. <br>
        HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>
      <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

      <h1>XML does not DO anything</h1>

      <p><strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</strong></p>
      <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created<br> to structure, store and to send information.</p>
      <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>
      <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. <br>
      But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped<br>
      in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
